"1 This column contains the figures provided by electoral administrators on Form K, however due to differing interpretations of this field, in part due to the wording of the form, this figure is not an accurate account of the total number of postal votes rejected. A more accurate figure can be found by subtracting the total number of postal votes included in the count (column AD) from the total number of covering envelopes recieved before the close of poll (column R).
